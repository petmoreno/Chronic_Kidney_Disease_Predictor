# Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Predictor
Project to create a CKD predictor using the public dataset of UCI Machine Learning Repository:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease
> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/).
> 
This repository will use the public dataset of UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
URL is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease

The objective of this projects is to try to outperform current papers and work with the same repository.

 - Paper to outperform: 10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2016.7508132 
 - Works are available in https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdiseasekaggle

Also after cleaning the data set of missing values and other inconsistences, the resultant data set will be upload to Kaggle

**Outline of works**

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 
	 a.Load data and summarizes
	 
	 b. Tables and DataViz
	 
	 c. Data missing handle
	 
	 d.Hypothesis testing 
	 
 2. Comparison different Classifiers (LogReg, SVM, DT, Bagging, RandomForest, KNN or ANN)
 
 3. Comparsion to aforementioned paper and other devs in kaggle
 
 4. Interpretability by showing features of importance in the oucomes
